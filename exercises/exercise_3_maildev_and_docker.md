## Exercise Description

### Mail Client

1. Research MailDev and how to implement it.

    - MailDev is an open-source SMTP server and web interface for viewing and testing emails during development. It is designed to help developers test email sending capabilities without actually sending emails to real email addresses. To implement MailDev, you will need to install it on your local machine or server. You can do this by following the instructions on the [MailDev GitHub page](https://github.com/maildev/maildev).

2. Write a brief summary of your findings.

    - After researching MailDev, write a brief summary of what you learned about it. Be sure to include information about what it is, how it works, and why it is useful for developers.

### Docker

1. Research Docker and containerization.

    - Docker is an open-source platform that allows developers to build, ship, and run applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that can run anywhere. They are designed to help developers create consistent environments across different machines and operating systems. To learn more about Docker and containerization, you can read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).

2. Research Docker build and Docker Compose.

    - Docker build is a command-line tool that allows developers to build Docker images from a Dockerfile. A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image. To learn more about Docker build, you can read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/).

    - Docker Compose is a tool that allows developers to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It uses a YAML file to define the services that make up an application, and then starts and stops those services as necessary. To learn more about Docker Compose, you can read the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

3. Research how to use MySQL and MailDev with Docker Compose.

    - MySQL is an open-source relational database management system that is commonly used in web applications. To use MySQL with Docker Compose, you will need to define a MySQL service in your docker-compose.yml file. You can then use this service in your application code to connect to the MySQL database.

    - To use MailDev with Docker Compose, you will need to define a MailDev service in your docker-compose.yml file. You can then use this service in your application code to send test emails during development.

4. Write a brief summary of your findings.

    - After researching Docker, containerization, Docker build, Docker Compose, MySQL, and MailDev with Docker Compose, write a brief summary of what you learned about each topic. Be sure to include information about what each topic is, how it works, and why it is useful for developers.
