## Exercise Description

### Part 1: Understanding Data Structures

Write an essay about different data structures. The essay should be structured as follows:

#### Introduction

Explain why understanding data structures is crucial for efficient programming and problem-solving. Discuss their role in organizing and managing data effectively.

#### Body

Discuss the following key data structures in detail:

1. **Arrays**

   - **Explanation**: Define arrays and explain their structure, which consists of a collection of elements identified by index or key.
   - **How it Works**: Describe how arrays store elements in contiguous memory locations and how indexing allows for fast access.
   - **Examples**: Provide scenarios where arrays are useful, such as storing a list of items or implementing other data structures like stacks and queues.
   - **Advantages**: Discuss the benefits of arrays, including constant-time access to elements and simplicity.
   - **Disadvantages**: Highlight the limitations, such as fixed size and inefficient insertion and deletion operations.

2. **Linked Lists**

   - **Explanation**: Define linked lists and explain their structure, which consists of nodes where each node contains data and a reference to the next node.
   - **Types of Linked Lists**: Discuss different types of linked lists, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists.
   - **Examples**: Provide scenarios where linked lists are useful, such as implementing dynamic data structures and managing memory efficiently.
   - **Advantages**: Discuss the benefits of linked lists, including dynamic size and efficient insertion and deletion operations.
   - **Disadvantages**: Highlight the limitations, such as linear-time access to elements and increased memory usage due to pointers.

3. **Stacks**

   - **Explanation**: Define stacks and explain their structure, which follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle.
   - **How it Works**: Describe how stacks use push and pop operations to add and remove elements.
   - **Examples**: Provide scenarios where stacks are useful, such as managing function calls in recursion and undo mechanisms in software.
   - **Advantages**: Discuss the benefits of stacks, including simplicity and efficient access to the most recently added elements.
   - **Disadvantages**: Highlight the limitations, such as limited access to elements and potential stack overflow.

4. **Queues**

   - **Explanation**: Define queues and explain their structure, which follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle.
   - **How it Works**: Describe how queues use enqueue and dequeue operations to add and remove elements.
   - **Examples**: Provide scenarios where queues are useful, such as managing tasks in a printer queue and handling requests in web servers.
   - **Advantages**: Discuss the benefits of queues, including simplicity and efficient access to the oldest elements.
   - **Disadvantages**: Highlight the limitations, such as limited access to elements and potential queue overflow.

5. **Trees**

   - **Explanation**: Define trees and explain their hierarchical structure, consisting of nodes with parent-child relationships.
   - **Types of Trees**: Discuss different types of trees, including binary trees, binary search trees, and AVL trees.
   - **Examples**: Provide scenarios where trees are useful, such as representing hierarchical data and implementing search algorithms.
   - **Advantages**: Discuss the benefits of trees, including efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
   - **Disadvantages**: Highlight the limitations, such as complexity in implementation and potential imbalance.

6. **Graphs**

   - **Explanation**: Define graphs and explain their structure, consisting of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).
   - **Types of Graphs**: Discuss different types of graphs, including directed and undirected graphs, weighted and unweighted graphs.
   - **Examples**: Provide scenarios where graphs are useful, such as representing networks and solving shortest path problems.
   - **Advantages**: Discuss the benefits of graphs, including flexibility in representing relationships and solving complex problems.
   - **Disadvantages**: Highlight the limitations, such as complexity in implementation and potential high memory usage.

#### Conclusion

Summarize the key points of the essay. Emphasize the importance of understanding different data structures and their impact on efficient programming and problem-solving. Discuss how mastering these concepts can lead to better performance and more optimized code.

### Part 2: Bank Simulation Project

Create a bank simulation program that uses different data structures to manage customers, accounts, and transactions. The project should include the following components:

#### Requirements

1. **Customer Management**
   - **Data Structure**: Use a **Linked List** to store customer information.
   - **Details**: Each customer should have a unique ID, name, and a list of accounts.

2. **Account Management**
   - **Data Structure**: Use an **Array** to store accounts for each customer.
   - **Details**: Each account should have a unique account number, account type (e.g., savings, checking), and balance.

3. **Transaction Management**
   - **Data Structure**: Use a **Queue** to manage transactions.
   - **Details**: Each transaction should have a transaction ID, account number, transaction type (e.g., deposit, withdrawal), and amount.

4. **Bank Operations**
   - **Data Structure**: Use a **Stack** to keep track of recent operations for undo functionality.
   - **Details**: Implement basic operations such as adding a customer, creating an account, depositing money, withdrawing money, and viewing account details.

5. **Reporting**
   - **Data Structure**: Use a **Tree** (e.g., Binary Search Tree) to store and retrieve transaction history efficiently.
   - **Details**: Implement a function to generate reports on transactions for a specific account or customer.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Define Data Structures**
   - Implement classes for Customer, Account, and Transaction.
   - Implement the Linked List, Array, Queue, Stack, and Tree data structures.

2. **Customer Management**
   - Create functions to add, remove, and search for customers in the linked list.

3. **Account Management**
   - Create functions to add, remove, and search for accounts in the array.

4. **Transaction Management**
   - Create functions to enqueue and dequeue transactions in the queue.

5. **Bank Operations**
   - Implement functions for depositing and withdrawing money, updating account balances, and pushing operations onto the stack for undo functionality.

6. **Reporting**
   - Implement functions to insert and search transactions in the tree.
   - Create functions to generate transaction reports.

#### Project Objectives

- **Understand Data Structures**: Gain practical experience with linked lists, arrays, queues, stacks, and trees.
- **Apply Concepts**: See how different data structures can be applied to solve real-world problems.
- **Build a Functional System**: Develop a working bank simulation that demonstrates the use of various data structures in managing customers, accounts, and transactions.

#### Conclusion

This project will help you understand how different data structures can be used together to build a functional and efficient system. By implementing this bank simulation, you'll gain practical experience with linked lists, arrays, queues, stacks, and trees, and see how they can be applied to solve real-world problems.
