 SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) is a framework used to plan, develop, test and deploy software systems, in other words it is a software creation system.
 it includes different phases namely:
 -analysis phase
 -design phase
 -testing phase
 -integration phase 
 -deployment phase
 -maintenance phase.

  We distinguish several types of SDLC model: V-shaped model, Waterfall model, Agile model and the spiral model.

  1-V model
  it is carried out in 2 phases, namely the descending phase and the ascending phase. It is also called the verification and validation model, its different stages are: collection and analysis of requirements, design (system design and detailed design), implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance.

  the phases of the v model are:
   Planning and Needs Analysis
   Functional specification
   system design and architecture.
   detailed design
   Implementation/coding
   Unit test
   Integrity test
   System test
   Acceptance test

   ADVANTAGE
   - he is disciplined
   - simple and easy to understand
   -he emphasizes testing
   -allows better communication

   DISADVANTAGES
   -presents high risks and insertitude
   -not good for complex projects
   -inflexibility (it is linear and sequential.)
   -excessive reliance on documentation
    Cascade model
    also called waterfall being a linear and sequential approach allowing the resolution of a problem. its use is such that the completion of each step depends on the previous step. as a small example: to carry out the construction of a house it is essential to build its foundations before being able to begin the construction of the walls and so on....
    Its stages are as follows: definition of needs, analysis, design, implementation, control and validation, commissioning

    The phases of the waterfall model are:
    requirements
    design 
    implementation/coding
    test
    interview

    ADVANTAGE
    -Complete documentation
    -stability of project scope
        
    DISADVANTAGES
    -limited flexibility
    -unsuitable for evolving projects

    Agile method (Agile manifesto)
    is a project management method we distinguish the kaban, scrum, extreme programming method.
    it bases its principle on 4 values:
    -individuals and interactions
    -operational software
    -collaboration with customers
    -adapting to changes
          
     AGILE SCRUM METHOD
     still called in French "mixed" is a framework that helps teams manage their work. it is frequently used by software development teams.

     for project management we need sprints. 
     A sprint is a defined period of time where all work must be done. The planning and execution of scrum sprints through the effect of collaboration between the product owner, the scrum master and the development team.

     -the product owner describes the objective in achieving the vision of the project. it maintains the inventory of tasks to be carried out (backlog).
     -the scrum master (leader coach) ensures that the teams adhere to the scrum principles
     -the development team made up of designers, programmers and engineers is responsible for the work of creating the project
      
     ADVANTAGE
     -the product can be modified at any time
     -Developments are divided into several parts and are carried out in rapid iterative cycles
     -ensures high quality deliveries
     -increase user satisfaction.

      DISADVANTAGES
      -Most people don't understand what it means to be Agile. 
      -The documentation of an agile product is generally less elaborate and detailed.
      -Agile culture is based on the idea that teams will not know what their end result will look like. 
      -Agile methodologies work best in small or medium-sized businesses.
