Relational algebra is a procedural query language that operates on relations, which are sets of tuples that represent data. Relational algebra uses operators such as select, project, join, union, and difference to manipulate relations and produce new relations as output. Relational algebra is useful for defining the semantics and logic of SQL queries.

Relational database is a type of database that stores and organizes data in tables, where each table has a fixed number of columns (attributes) and a variable number of rows (records). Relational database uses a relational model to represent the data and the relationships among them. Relational database supports SQL as the standard query language for accessing and manipulating data.

Here are some links to tutorials and articles that explain relational algebra and relational database in more detail:

- [Relational Algebra | Tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dbms/relational_algebra.htm) - This tutorial covers the basic operations of relational algebra, such as select, project, union, set difference, Cartesian product, rename, theta join, natural join, division, and assignment.
- [Relational Database Design | Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/relational-database-design) - This course teaches you how to design a relational database from scratch, using entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), relational models, normalization rules, and SQL commands.
- [Database design basics - Microsoft Support](https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/database-design-basics-eb2159cf-1e30-401a-8084-bd4f9c9ca1f5) - This article provides guidelines for planning a desktop database using Access. It explains how to divide the information into tables and columns, specify primary keys, create table relationships, refine the design, and apply the normalization rules.
- [SQL Syntax - W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_syntax.asp) - This tutorial introduces you to the SQL syntax, such as keywords, clauses, statements, expressions, predicates, operators, and comments. It also shows you how to use some of the most important SQL commands, such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, and JOIN.

Now that you have some resources to learn from, let's try to create an exercise for your interns. The exercise will consist of three parts: designing an ERD for a blog application, creating a SQL file to create the database based on the ERD, and writing some SQL queries to perform various tasks on the database.

Part 1: Designing an ERD for a blog application

A blog application is a web-based platform that allows users to create and share posts on various topics. A blog application typically has the following features:

- Users can register and log in with their email and password.
- Users can create posts with a title, content, category, and date.
- Users can edit or delete their own posts.
- Users can view posts by other users or by category.
- Users can comment on posts by other users.
- Users can like or dislike posts by other users.

To design an ERD for a blog application, we need to identify the entities (things) involved in the system and their attributes (properties). We also need to define the relationships (associations) between the entities and their cardinalities (multiplicities).

Here is one possible ERD for a blog application:

![ERD for blog application](#graphic_art("ERD for blog application"))

In this ERD,

- We have four entities: User, Post, Comment, and Category.
- Each entity has a primary key (underlined) that uniquely identifies each record in the table. For example, user_id is the primary key for User table.
- Each entity has some attributes that store information about it. For example, User table has attributes such as email, password, name,
  bio,
  etc.
- There are three relationships between the entities: one-to-many (1:M), many-to-one (M:1), and many-to-many (M:N).
- A one-to-many relationship means that one record in one table can be related to many records in another table. For example,
  one user can create many posts,
  but each post belongs to only one user. We use a foreign key (italicized) in the many side table to reference the primary key in
  the one side table. For example,
  user_id is a foreign key in Post table that references user_id in User table.
- A many-to-one relationship means that many records in one table can be related to one record in another table. For example,
  many posts can belong to one category,
  but each category can have many posts. We use a foreign key in the many side table to reference the primary key in
  the one side table. For example,
  category_id is a foreign key in Post table that references category_id in Category table.
- A many-to-many relationship means that many records in one table can be related to many records in another table. For example,
  many users can comment on many posts,
  and many posts can have many comments. We use a junction table (Comment) to store the combination of primary keys from both tables. For example,
  Comment table has two foreign keys: user_id and post_id, that reference user_id in User table and post_id in Post table, respectively.

Part 2: Creating a SQL file to create the database based on the ERD

To create a SQL file to create the database based on the ERD, we need to use the CREATE TABLE statement to define the structure of each table and its columns. We also need to use the CONSTRAINT clause to specify the primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints for each table. 
Consider Tables (users, categories, posts, comments, likes) where a post can be of one category, and a user can like many post.

Part 3: Writing some SQL queries to perform various tasks on the database

To write some SQL queries to perform various tasks on the database, we need to use the SELECT statement to retrieve data from one or more tables. We also need to use the WHERE clause to filter the data based on some conditions, the JOIN clause to combine data from multiple tables based on some relationships, the GROUP BY clause to group the data into subsets based on some criteria, and the ORDER BY clause to sort the data in ascending or descending order. Here are some examples of SQL queries for various tasks:

-- Query 1: Find all posts by a given user
-- Query 2: Find all comments on a given post
-- Query 3: Find all posts that have at least one comment
-- Query 4: Find all categories and their number of posts
-- Query 5: Find all users and their number of likes and dislikes

I hope this exercise helps you  learn more about relational algebra and relational database. If you have any questions or feedback, please let me know. Have a great day! ðŸ˜Š
