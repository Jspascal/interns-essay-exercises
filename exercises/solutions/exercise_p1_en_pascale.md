# **EXPOSEE ON GIT**
- ## **GITHUB**
GitHub is an online service that permit to guarder the Git repository. It is the largest repository git host of the world.
Many of the repositories hosted on GitHub are public, which means that anyone can download the code from these repositories and contribute to their developement by contributing new featurs.
To use GitHub, simply create a free account on the site https://github.com. The great interest of GitHub is to facilitate collaborationon a planetary scale on projects, thatis to say that anyone will be able to retrieve projects and contribute to them (unless the owner of the project doesn't allow it of course).
On GitHub, we have the power to clone public projects (repositories), fork the projects or contributes on projects in  proposing sommes modifications (“pull request”).
The different steps for contributing on a project are :
1.	We copy a project on our GitHub space ;
2.	We create a branch via the master ;
3.	we do somes modifications / ameliorations to the project ; 
4.	We push the local branch to the project that we copied from GitHub and then open a request on GitHub ;
5.	The owner of the projects then have to choose either refuse the modifications or to merge it on the original project ;
6.	We upgrade a new version of our project by taking back the last modifications via the original project.

Advantages of using GitHub :
•   This server can be persieve as social network for programmers representing the largest global community. 
•	Developers can share their work in a public way and recieve help or a beneficial exposition.
•	As soon as a project is posted, all the programmers and other enthusiasts can evaluate it.


## **BITBUCKET**
Bitbucket cloud is a Git-based code hosting and collaboration tool built for teams. Bitbucket's integration with Jira and Trello are designed to bring the entire developement team together arround a project and provide access to branches, built status commit and status via Jira issues or Trello cards.

## **Some brief overview of Bitbucket**
• It permits collaboration around codes of the clpoud concepts.
• Permit to develope and authomatically test through CI.
• Allows you to deply with confidense
• Allows you to secure your code
• It allows an unlimited number of private code repository for Git

## **Bitbucket hosting options**
 Cloud:
 Bitbucket cloud is hosted on server via une URL. It dispose of an exclusif intergrated CI/CD tool and pipelines that permites to develope, test and deploy directly through Bitbucket.

 server:
 Le Bitbucket's server is a host on the site. It disposes of solid integration in Bamboo, and the CI/CD tool that entirely automise your process.

 Data Center:

• Bitbucket is reliable
• Semantic searches are smart
• Bitbucket has a high integration with Jira and Trello

Disadvantages of Bitbucket
• Community
• Plugins

## **GITLAB** 
GitLab is an open source DevOps platform built on the control version software Git. It allows you to create , test and develop softwres in a collaborative way. Gitlab is available in SaaS mode. 

### The features offered by the platform:

**Source code management:**  Allows us to track and verify each modification made to the source code, and manage its distribution from a single dashboard.
**Continuous Intehration an Delivery:** Use CI/CD to integrateyour code and test it quickly, setting up acontinuouschain.
**Planning :** Free access to portfolio management to monitor the progress of tasksin real time.
**Security :** Each code commits is automatically analysed and Gitlab is able to detect vulnerabilities in your code and associated dependencies.
GitLab helps teams reduce product lifecycles and increase productivity, which in turn creates value for customers. The application doesn't require users to manage authorizations for each tool. If permissions are set once, then everyone in the organization has access to every component.
### Why Use GitLab?
The main benefit of using GitLab is that it allows all the team members to collaborate in every phase of the project. GitLab offers tracking from planning to creation to help developers automate the entire DevOps lifecycle and achieve the best possible results. More and more developers have started to use GitLab because of its wide assortment of features and brick blocks of code availability.
