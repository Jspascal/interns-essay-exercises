# FTP (File Transfer Protocol)

FTP is used to transfder data and files between client and servers from the computer network. FTp is a communication protocol intended for file sharing on a TCP/IP network. It allows, from a computer? to copy files to another computer on the network, or to delete or modify files on this computer. This copy mechanism is often used to feed a website hosted by a third party.
The variant of FTP protected by the SSL or TLS protocol is called FTPS. FTP obeys a client-server model, that is to say that one of the two parties, the client, sends requests to the other, called the server reacts. In practice,  the server is a computer running software itself called called FTP server, which makes public a tree structure of files similar to a UNIX file system.
To access an FTP server, you use FTP client software (witha graphical or command-libne interface).

Through an FTP we can therefore speak pf the FTP server and the FTP CLient.

### The FTP server
We talk about an FTP servber to refer to the software that will process customer requests. he takes care of checki,g the rights and responding to the request.

### FTP client
An FTP client is an application running on a computer and used to retrieve files from a server running the FTP daemon(FTPd).The FTP client will initiate daa transaction by connecting to the FTP server to perform an order(in text format).

Here is a selection of the best FTP clients;

FileZilla: This is the essential reference in FTP in particular thanks to its free and multiplatform nature . In the event of a problem? you will be able to benefit from an availableand responsive customer service and this assistance doesn't go Unnoticed by users.
This will allow you to transfer your files simply while enjoying a secure transfer for files.

Cyberduck: This FTP client available on Windows and Mac allows you to manage files online by supporting FTp and SFTP without forgtting the connection to many servers(Google drive, DropBox Amazon S3 etc).If you are just starting out Cyberduck can be a graet solution with its easy-to-use interface and handy forwarding Url generator.

WinSCP: This free FTP client available only on windows allows you to transfer and download files remotely while using a complete interface with the possibility of multiplying tabs. However, if yoy are new to this field this FTP client could quickly lose you with its many options.

Its specification is due to the fact that it allows the exchange of commands and data between a computer or software the FTP client and a server.

### Importances of FTP
1.Easy to use: FTP is easy to use and almost anyone can use it to transfer files from one computer to another.

2. Secure: The FTP protocol uses encryption to protect data in transit,making it a secure way to transfer files over the internet.

3. Efficient: The FTP protocol is very efficient allowing you to transfer large files quickly and easily.

4. Reliable: FTP is a reliable way to transferfiles, with little or no downtime.


# SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
 It is defined as a communication protocol used to transfer electronic mail(email) to electronic mail server which is quite somple.
 The steps for transfering mail via SMTP are broken down into 4 main phases.
 In the fist step, the transmission is made from the MUA of the sender to the transmission server using the SMTP protocol.In the second step, the email is made from MTA to MTA until it reaches that of therecipient. This is also done through the SMTP protocol. During the 3rd phase, the transmission takes place from the MTA to the MDA which keeps the electronic mail so that it can be read. In reality, a request is made from the recipient's MUA to the MDA to make this possible.

 ### SMTP server:
 An SMTP server is a device that sends email to a server intended to collect them. This process is naturally based on the "simple mail transfer protocol". Since serveral servers are involved in relaying to its final destination, it can be percieved that a server is used to recieve an email through SMTP.

 ### SMTP relay:
 It results in the action of relaying email to the destination server. However, it also makes it possible to designayte the servers through which the emails pass and reach their destination. In this case, the term refers to the function of post relays and is therefore a synonym for SMPT server.

 SMTP is specifically responsible for sending and forwarding emails from a sender to a recipient.

 ### Apllications of SMTP
 -Microsoft

 -Outlook: It is a software from the Microsoft Office suite which allows the reception and sending of emails to classify them, but also the management of a complete address book, the management of task and your time. 

 -Mozilla Thunderbird: Is an open source email management software, distrinuted free of charge by the Mozilla Foundation. This solution allows you to add already existing email providers. It is easy ton cnfigure secure and customizable.
 It uses web mail services such as Gmail and Yahoo.

 ### Importances of SMTP
 -It ensures the delivery of email from the client application to the outgoing mail server, and from this server to the destination server.

 -The SMTP protocoldoesn't requires authentication, which allows anyone to send an email to another.


 # SSH Connections
 SSH (Secure shell), is a network protocol that allows administrators to acces a computer remotely, securely.
 SSH also designates all the utilities that implement the protocol.

 SSH uses encryption to secure communications, whichg means that transferred data connot be read or modified by unauthorized third parties. This makes SSH especially useful for remote logins over unsecured public networks, such as internet connections.


 ### How SSH works:
 The way SSH work is that it uses a client-server model to allow authentication of two remote systems and encryption of data passing through them. SSH runs on TCP port 22 default.

 ### Importances of SSH
 -The main advantage of SSh is the use of encryption to ensure secure information transfer between client and server.

 -SSH allows users to execute shell commnands on a remote computer as if they were in front of the physical machine.

 -SSH allows two computer to establish a direct and secure connection within a potentially insecure network, suchn as the internet.

 -Allows you to execute commands and move files from one computer to another.

 ### SSH clients
 The SSH clients is usually your own computer with which  you want to establish a connection to the server. TO do this, you can or must(depending on the operating system) install separate software that establishes an SSH connection.These programs are also called SSH clients.
