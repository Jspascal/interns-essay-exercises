### Protocols
    Protocols refers to procedures or set of rules that enables devices to communicate and share resources over a network.
    In order to communicate, these devices must share a same protocol which is needed to translate the communication between the devices.
### Kinds of Network Protocols
    there are three main types of protocols;
    1- Network Management Protocol: These protocols are set of rules put in place to monitor, manage and maintain a network.
        examples: Telnet, FTP, SNMP.

    2- Network Communication Protocol: A set of rules for exchanging data across a network.
        examples: UDP, TCP, IP, HTTP.

    3- Network Security Protocol: As the name implies, they are set of rules for security measure such as cryptography and encryption.
        exanples: HTTPS, SSL.
    
### Types of Network Protocols
    a- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol): Its is the most widely used protocol because it breaks down data into packets so it can be transfer accurately and very rapidly throught a server.

    b- TCP/IP (Internet Protocol): Here, the internet protocol (IP) identifies and defines the ip address of devices or app receiving   the data and the TCP then forwards the data by establishing a connection on both sides before forwarding the data.

    c- UDP (User Datagram Protocol): Just like TCP, UDP sends data in packet form over a network but at a much more higher speed. 
    Not very accurate because due to its high speed, there is often data loss in process.
    - UDP better supports video\audio streaming, online games, Voice-over-internet-protocol (VoIP) because it can handle potential data loss.
    - Donot establish a link with both parties before forwarding data hence accuracy cannot be guarantee since the packet can be lost.

    d- FTP (File Transfer Protocol): FTP sends data over an unencrypted TCP/IP 
    - Can send up to 2GB of data at once. Very rapidly at the cost of Security.
    - A secure FTP exist, FTPS (File Transfer Protocol Secure Socket Layer): It function same as the normal FTP but uses SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption to hide the data transmited

    e- HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol): A communication protocol that enables systems to communicate on the World Wide Web. A client will send a hypertext request to a web server for access, the server hosting the content will process the request and forward the access as respond.
