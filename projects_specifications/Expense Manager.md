### Overview

During your internship at Lab2View, you will have to build an **Expense Management App**, powered by **Laravel** and other PHP tools. This app should simplifies expense handling and integrates seamlessly. It caters to businesses seeking efficient expense management.

### System Overview

The system will consist of a mobile application (or web app accessible through mobile browsers) where users can submit and track their personal expenses.

**Technology Stack:**

- **Backend:** Laravel Framework (version compatible with PHP 8.2 or higher)
- **Database:** A relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL to store expense data and user information.
- **Mobile App Development:** The specific framework or tools used for mobile app development depend on whether you choose a native app (platform-specific) or a web app approach.

### Functional Requirements

**User Roles:**

- **Users:**
    - Create and manage personal expense reports.
    - Capture details like expense amount, date, category, and a brief description (optional).
    - Optionally, categorize expenses (predefined or custom categories).
    - View and manage their past expense history.

**Core functionalities:**

- **Expense Submission:**
    - Users can create new expense entries.
    - Capture details like expense amount, date, and optional category/description.
    - Save the expense entry for future reference.
- **Expense Management:**
    - Users can view and edit their past expense entries.
    - Implement filtering and searching functionality based on date range, category, etc. (optional).

**Data Visualization and Analytics:**

- **Expense Overview:** Provide users with a visual representation of their overall expenses (e.g., pie chart, bar chart).
- **Category Breakdown:** Analyze spending patterns by category to identify areas of high spending.
- **Trend Analysis:** Track spending trends over time (e.g., monthly, quarterly) to gain insights into budgeting needs.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The application should be responsive and provide a user-friendly experience on mobile devices.
- **Security:** Implement secure user authentication and data encryption mechanisms to protect user privacy.
- **Offline Functionality:** Consider functionalities for capturing expense details even when offline (data syncing later) for the mobile app (optional).

### Additional Considerations

- **Data Export:** Allow users to export their expense data in various formats (CSV, PDF) for further analysis or sharing.
- **Budgeting Tools:** Explore the possibility of integrating basic budgeting functionalities in future versions.
- **Multilingual Support:** Consider the need for multi-language support if the app targets a global audience.
